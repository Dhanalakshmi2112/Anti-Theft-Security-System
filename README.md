# Anti-Theft-Security-System
The Anti-theft security system designed to detect intruders and alert the user. 
The proposed system is built with a piezo sensor installed under the floor and a PI Pico W microcontroller. 
The piezo sensor detects the presence of an intruder and triggers an alarm, which is sent to the PI Pico W microcontroller.
Microcontroller then sends a notification to the user, notifying them of the potential threat.
The device includes a servo motor to control the camera angle.
Piezo sensor detects the pressure and passes the signal to the Pi Pico W.
The PI Pico W send the instruction to the servo motor to move where the pressure was detected. 
Later, with the help of ESP32 CAM the photo is captured.
The application was designed to control the actions such Buzzer, lights, Hidden door and along with live stream of the captured photo . 
The user can control the actions with the help of switch in the application.
The proposed system is cost-effective, efficient, and easy to install and operate.
